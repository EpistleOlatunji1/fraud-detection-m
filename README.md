# fraud-detection-m
Machine learning project for fraud risk detection using transaction and customer data. A supervised model estimates fraud probabilities for unseen transactions, demonstrating preprocessing, categorical encoding, and inference in a realistic financial fraud detection workflow.
# Fraud Risk Detection Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a **fraud risk detection model** using transaction and customer data. The model predicts the likelihood of fraud in unseen transactions using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression. The goal is to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

## 📝 Project Overview

### Objective
- Build a machine learning model to predict **fraudulent transactions** based on customer and transaction data.
  
### Data
The dataset includes:
- **Transaction-level data**: Amount, category, anomaly score, timestamp, etc.
- **Customer-level data**: Account balance, suspicious flag, etc.

### Methodology

- Used a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification.
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables and **class balancing** for training.
- Predicted fraud risk probabilities for unseen transactions.

### Features Used:
- **Transaction Amount**
- **Anomaly Score**
- **Transaction Category**
- **Suspicious Flag**
- **Account Balance**
